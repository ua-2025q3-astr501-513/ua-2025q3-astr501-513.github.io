    "   dispersive error that causes different wave components to travel at\n",
    "   slightly different speeds.\n",
    "   This leads to phase errors where waveforms become distorted over\n",

    "3. Impact on Solution Accuracy:\n",
    "   The introduced dispersive term does not counteract the\n",

    "   Instead, it modifies the original equation in a way that can\n",
    "   exacerbate inaccuracies, especially for higher-frequency components\n",

    "5. Practical Considerations:\n",
