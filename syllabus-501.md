### Required or Special Materials

As a course on computational physics, students are excepted to have
access to computers.
Although not required, students will be encouraged to install popular
development tools such as `git`, `python`, and `JupyterLab` to their
computers.

### Required Extracurricular Activities

The instructor will provide students additional online videos to
broaden the students' knowledge on computational physics.
When bundled with assignments, students are required to watch them.
When provided as references, the videos are optional.

Near the end of the semester, students are encouraged to join a field
trip to UA's Computer Center and see our supercomputers.

## Assignments and Examinations

### Schedule/Due Dates

This course includes 12 in-class, hands-on labs.
There should be enough time during class for students to finish the labs.

### Writing Requirement

Although this is not a writing intensive course, good documentation is
essential in communicating science and developing software, and will be
used in evaluating homework and/or projects.

### Final Examination or Project

Presentations are scheduled on November 26th and December 3rd.

## Grading Scale and Policies

This course provides pass/fail grades.
Students who finish majority of hands-on labs and create reasonable
projects would receive passing grades.

**Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):**
Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in
accordance with University policy, which is available at
https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/courses-credit/grading/grading-system.

**Dispute of Grade Policy:**
If a student disagrees on his or her grade on a homework assignment or
a project, the student must send the instructor a formal request
through email to re-evaluate the grade within a week from the time
that the student receives the grade.
Because no scaling will be applied in the final grade, the final grade
cannot be re-evaluated.
A student is expected to know his or her own performance throughout
the course.

## Code of Conduct

### Classroom Behavior Policy

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors
have a shared responsibility.
We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us
feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves
to succeed.
To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous
activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone
calls, web surfing, etc.).

### Threatening Behavior Policy

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of
physical harm to any member of the University community, including to
oneself.
See
http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students.

### Accessibility and Accommodations

At the University of Arizona, we strive to make learning experiences
as accessible as possible.
If you anticipate or experience barriers based on disability or
pregnancy, please contact the Disability Resource Center (520-621-3268,
https://drc.arizona.edu) to establish reasonable accommodations.

### Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely
the principles and applications of course materials.
However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent
effort unless otherwise instructed.
Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity
as described in the UA General Catalog.
See:
https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/academic-integrity.

The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding
plagiarism, available at
https://lib.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism.

Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or
to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor's
express written consent.
Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of
Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions.
Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these
copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for
misuse of student e-mail addresses.
This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

### Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an
environment free of discrimination.
In support of this commitment, the University prohibits
discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a
protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex
(including pregnancy), national origin, age, disability, veteran
status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information.
For more information, including how to report a concern, please see
https://policy.arizona.edu/employment-human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express
well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions.
We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such
opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or
discrimination of others.

### Usage of Generative AI

Homework, projects, and exams in this course are designed to help
students apply class concepts, test their understanding, and develop
skills in software development and scientific communication.
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub Copilot
can be valuable for brainstorming, exploring alternative approaches,
clarifying confusing concepts, and debugging code.
Students may also use these tools to clarify difficult concepts and to
generate examples that aid their learning.

However, students must write their own code, take full responsibility
for their work, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the
underlying concepts.
While AI tools can support learning, they may produce inaccurate,
incomplete, or biased results.
Students are responsible for verifying facts, testing code, and
critically assessing all submitted material.

Any use of generative AI must be acknowledged or cited (see guidelines
from UA library).
Failure to disclose such use, or submitting work that is not original,
will be considered a violation of academic integrity.

For questions, contact your instructor.
