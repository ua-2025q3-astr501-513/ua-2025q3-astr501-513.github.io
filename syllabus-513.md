numerically in astrophysics and the foundations of modern statistical
methods that are used in current research problems, with emphasis on
big-data science.
The topics will include basic scientific algorithms to solve integrals
and simple differential equations frequently encountered in
astrophysics, frequentist and Bayesian inference methods, non-linear
regressions methods, modeling of data, Monte Carlo techniques, error
estimation, and model selection.

essential in communicating science and developing software.

### Final Examination or Project

...

## Grading Scale and Policies

...

**Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):**
Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in
accordance with University policy, which is available at
https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/courses-credit/grading/grading-system.

**Dispute of Grade Policy:**
If a student disagrees on his or her grade on a homework assignment or

## Code of Conduct

### Classroom Behavior Policy

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors
have a shared responsibility.
We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us
feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves
to succeed.
To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous
activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone
calls, web surfing, etc.).

### Threatening Behavior Policy

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of
physical harm to any member of the University community, including to
oneself.
See
http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students.

### Accessibility and Accommodations

At the University of Arizona, we strive to make learning experiences
as accessible as possible.
If you anticipate or experience barriers based on disability or
pregnancy, please contact the Disability Resource Center (520-621-3268,
https://drc.arizona.edu) to establish reasonable accommodations.

### Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely
the principles and applications of course materials.
However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent
effort unless otherwise instructed.
Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity
as described in the UA General Catalog.
See:
https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/academic-integrity.

The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding
plagiarism, available at
https://lib.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism.

Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or
to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor's
express written consent.
Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of
Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions.
Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these
copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for
misuse of student e-mail addresses.
This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

### Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an
environment free of discrimination.
In support of this commitment, the University prohibits
discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a
protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex
(including pregnancy), national origin, age, disability, veteran
status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information.
For more information, including how to report a concern, please see
https://policy.arizona.edu/employment-human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express
well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions.
We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such
opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or
discrimination of others.

### Usage of Generative AI

Homework and projects in this course are designed to help students
apply class concepts, test their learning, and develop software
development and science communication skills.
Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub
Co-Pilot, can be useful for brainstorming and debugging.
However, students must write their own code, take full responsibility
for their work, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the concepts.

While AI tools can assist learning, they may produce inaccurate or
biased outputs.
Students are responsible for verifying facts and critically assessing
all submitted material.
Any use of generative AI must be acknowledged or cited (see
[guidelines from UA
library](https://libguides.library.arizona.edu/students-chatgpt/citing)).
Failure to disclose such use or to write original code will be
considered a violation of academic integrity.

For questions, contact your instructor.
