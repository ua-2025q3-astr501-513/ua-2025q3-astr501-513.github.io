Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of Students (or Dean Designee)
will be honored.
See:
https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/policies/attendance-policies-and-practices

Participating in the course and attending lectures and other course
events are vital to the learning process.
As such, attendance is required at all lectures and discussion section
meetings.
Absences may affect a student's final course grade.
If you anticipate being absent, are unexpectedly absent, or are unable
to participate in class online activities, please contact me as soon
as possible.
To request a disability-related accommodation to this attendance
policy, please contact the Disability Resource Center at (520)
621-3268 or disability@arizona.edu.
If you are experiencing unexpected barriers to your success in your
courses, the Dean of Students Office is a central support resource for
all students and may be helpful.
The Dean of Students Office is located in the Robert L. Nugent
Building, room 100, or call 520-621-7057.

### Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late

Statement on whether students who register after the first class
meeting may make up missed assignments/quizzes and the deadline for
doing so.

### Course Communications

Email is the official method to communicate with the instructor and
teaching assistant outside scheduled classes and office hours.

## Course Materials

### Required Texts or Readings

**Required Text:** None

**References:**

### Required or Special Materials

As a course on computational physics, students are excepted to have
access to computers.
Although not required, students will be encouraged to install popular
development tools such as `git`, `python`, and `JupyterLab` to their
computers.

### Required Extracurricular Activities

The instructor will provide students additional online videos to
broaden the students' knowledge on computational physics.
When bundled with assignments, students are required to watch them.
When provided as references, the videos are optional.

Near the end of the semester, students are encouraged to join a field
trip to UA's Computer Center and see our supercomputers.

## Assignments and Examinations

### Schedule/Due Dates

This course includes 10 homework assignments.
The due dates are listed in the schedule.
We try to give at least one week of time for finishing each homework.
Late homework will received reduced grades.

### Writing Requirement

Although this is not a writing intensive course, good documentation is
essential in communicating science and developing software, and will be
used in evaluating homework and/or projects.

### Project

Students are expected to work in groups of 3 to 6 for their
projects.
Each project is will be evaluated on four criteria:
i)   originality and clarity of the idea,
ii)  quality of the solution,
iii) thoroughness of the documentation, and
iv)  effectiveness of the presentation.
Presentations are scheduled during the week of October 12.
The final project package, including presentation slides and any
supporting materials, must be submitted on the day of the presentation.

### Final Examination

A written final exam is scheduled on December 10th.

## Grading Scale and Policies

The course includes 10 homework assignments, 1 project, and 1 final
exam.
Each homework is worth 5 points, the project is worth 20 points, and
the final exam is worth 30 points.
The total is 100 points.

This course provides regular letter grades (A-E), which are based on a
simple point system:
* A: 90-100  points
* B: 80-89.9 points
* C: 70-79.9 points
* D: 60-69.9 points
* E:  0-59.9 points

No scaling will be applied.
However, there are multiple opportunities to obtain extra credits.

**Incomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):**
Requests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in
accordance with University policy, which is available at
https://catalog.arizona.edu/policy/courses-credit/grading/grading-system.

**Dispute of Grade Policy:**
If a student disagrees on his or her grade on a homework assignment or
a project, the student must send the instructor a formal request
through email to re-evaluate the grade within a week from the time
that the student receives the grade.
Because no scaling will be applied in the final grade, the final grade
cannot be re-evaluated.
A student is expected to know his or her own performance throughout
the course.

## Code of Conduct

### Classroom Behavior Policy

To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors
have a shared responsibility.
We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us
feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves
to succeed.
To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous
activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone
calls, web surfing, etc.).

### Threatening Behavior Policy

The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of
physical harm to any member of the University community, including to
oneself.
See
http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students.

### Accessibility and Accommodations

At the University of Arizona, we strive to make learning experiences
as accessible as possible.
If you anticipate or experience barriers based on disability or
pregnancy, please contact the Disability Resource Center (520-621-3268,
https://drc.arizona.edu) to establish reasonable accommodations.

### Code of Academic Integrity

Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely
the principles and applications of course materials.
However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent
effort unless otherwise instructed.
Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity
as described in the UA General Catalog.
See:
https://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/student-rights-responsibilities/academic-integrity.

The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding
plagiarism, available at
https://lib.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism.

Selling class notes and/or other course materials to other students or
to a third party for resale is not permitted without the instructor's
express written consent.
Violations to this and other course rules are subject to the Code of
Academic Integrity and may result in course sanctions.
Additionally, students who use D2L or UA e-mail to sell or buy these
copyrighted materials are subject to Code of Conduct Violations for
misuse of student e-mail addresses.
This conduct may also constitute copyright infringement.

### Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy

The University of Arizona is committed to creating and maintaining an
environment free of discrimination.
In support of this commitment, the University prohibits
discrimination, including harassment and retaliation, based on a
protected classification, including race, color, religion, sex
(including pregnancy), national origin, age, disability, veteran
status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or genetic information.
For more information, including how to report a concern, please see
https://policy.arizona.edu/employment-human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy

Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express
well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions.
We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such
opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or
discrimination of others.

### Usage of Generative AI

Homework, projects, and exams in this course are designed to help
students apply class concepts, test their understanding, and develop
skills in software development and scientific communication.
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub Copilot
can be valuable for brainstorming, exploring alternative approaches,
clarifying confusing concepts, and debugging code.
Students may also use these tools to clarify difficult concepts and to
generate examples that aid their learning.

However, students must write their own code, take full responsibility
for their work, and demonstrate a clear understanding of the
underlying concepts.
While AI tools can support learning, they may produce inaccurate,
incomplete, or biased results.
Students are responsible for verifying facts, testing code, and
critically assessing all submitted material.

Any use of generative AI must be acknowledged or cited (see guidelines
from UA library).
Failure to disclose such use, or submitting work that is not original,
will be considered a violation of academic integrity.

For questions, contact your instructor.
